// Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

var alien_color = 'green';

//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

if(alien_color === 'green'){
    console.log("the player just earned 5 points");
}

//• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

if(alien_color !== 'green'){
    
}
